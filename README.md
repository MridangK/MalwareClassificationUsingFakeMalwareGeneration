## Introduction

Malware classification is a challenging task in cybersecurity. Traditional approaches rely on manually crafted features, which can be time-consuming and may not capture the full complexity of modern malware. This project proposes a novel approach that leverages the power of generative models to generate synthetic malware samples for training a malware classifier.

The core idea is to use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and specifically Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to learn the underlying distribution of malware samples. By training the generator to produce realistic malware samples, we can then use these synthetic samples, along with real malware samples, to train a classifier. This approach aims to improve the classifier's performance by augmenting the training data with diverse and realistic synthetic samples.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to follow these installation steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/MalwareClassificationUsingFakeMalwareGeneration.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After completing the installation steps, you can use the provided scripts for various tasks related to malware classification using fake malware generation:

- `train.py`: This script trains the GAN/WGAN-GP model using the specified configuration.

- `generate_samples.py`: Use this script to generate synthetic malware samples using the trained model.

- `train_classifier.py`: Train a malware classifier using both real and synthetic malware samples.

- `evaluate_classifier.py`: Evaluate the performance of the trained classifier on a test dataset.

Please refer to the source code and accompanying documentation for detailed instructions on how to use these scripts effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of real malware samples collected from various sources. Due to licensing and privacy restrictions, we cannot include the dataset in this repository. However, you can obtain a similar malware dataset from public malware repositories or contact the authors for more information.

## Model Architecture

The GAN/WGAN-GP model used in this project follows a specific architecture designed to generate realistic malware samples. The generator network takes random noise as input and produces synthetic malware samples. The discriminator network tries to distinguish between real and fake malware samples. The loss functions and training techniques specific to GANs and WGAN-GP are implemented to optimize the model parameters effectively.

For more details on the model architecture, refer to the source code and accompanying documentation.

## Training

To train the GAN/WGAN-GP model, you can use the `train.py` script. Adjust the configuration parameters according to your specific requirements, such as the dataset path, hyperparameters, and training options. Run the script with the desired configuration to initiate the training process.

## Evaluation

After training the model and generating synthetic malware samples, you can evaluate the performance of the trained classifier using the `evaluate_classifier.py` script. Provide the trained model and the evaluation dataset as inputs to the script. It will output various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results

The results obtained from this project indicate the effectiveness of using synthetic malware samples generated by GAN/WGAN-GP for improving the performance of malware classifiers. The evaluation metrics demonstrate significant improvements over traditional approaches. Refer to the accompanying documentation or contact the authors for more detailed analysis and results.
